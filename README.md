# dotfiles

This directory/repository contains my configuration files. These files usually start with a `.` hence the name `dotfiles`.

I also call them my dotties but that's probably just me.

Small note:
I usually use Debian based distributions so these commands are for `apt`
but change the package manager if you're using something else like Arch or Fedora.

## Requirements

To easily manage these file I use git (duh) and [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

### Git

```sh
sudo apt install git
```

### stow

```sh
sudo apt install stow
```
